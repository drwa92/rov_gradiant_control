# üê† Active Vision-Based Real-Time Aquaculture Net Pen Inspection Using ROV

This repository contains the source code, models, and scripts used in the paper:

> **Waseem Akram et al.**, *"Active vision-based real-time aquaculture net pens inspection using ROV"*, 2025.

---

##  Overview

This project presents a novel **gradient-aware active vision system** for aquaculture net inspection using a **commercial ROV**. It integrates:

- A **learning-based pose controller** to maintain optimal ROV positioning using image gradients.
- A **CNN-based distance classification model** to support robust pose estimation.
- A **YOLO-based defect detector** for identifying net holes and plastic debris.

---

##  Key Features

-  **Gradient-aware pose control** using CNNs for desired inspection distance.
-  **Dual-sided gradient regulation** for precise yaw control.
-  **YOLOv5-based net defect detection** (holes, plastic debris).
-  **Tested in both pool and real fish farm environments**.

##  Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- ROS2 (Foxy or Humble)
- YOLOv5 repo (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- Blueye Python SDK (if deploying on Blueye ROV)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/drwa92/rov_gradiant_control.git
cd rov_gradiant_control

```

##  Distance Classification Module

This module utilizes the publicly available [MobileNetV2](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.mobilenet_v2.html) architecture to classify the ROV's inspection distance relative to the aquaculture net.

### Provided Assets

- **Trained Model:** [`mobilenetv2.pth`](distance_classification/MobileNetV2/mobilenetv2.pth)
- **Custom Dataset:** Located in [`distance_classification/dataset`](distance_classification/dataset), annotated with three distance classes:
  - `Far`
  - `Close`
  - `Good`


### Inference Example

To run predictions using the trained model:

```bash
python distance_classification.py
```
---

## Net Defect Detection (YOLOv5)

This module uses a custom-trained **YOLOv5** model to detect **net defects**, specifically *holes* and *plastic debris*. The code supports input from videos, webcam, or a live ROV stream.

### Folder Structure

- `Test data/`: Contains sample videos to test the trained model.
- `dataset/`: Includes the custom dataset used for training, with annotations for *holes* and *plastic*.



###  Setup

1. Clone the YOLOv5 repository:

```bash
cd defect_detection
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
```

### Running Inference

To run detection on a test video or a live ROV stream, edit the `capture_source` in `yolo_inference.py`:

Then launch the script:

```bash
python yolo_inference.py
```

This will open a window displaying detections with bounding boxes and FPS.

---

##  Real-Time ROS2 Interface

Ensure your Blueye ROV is connected and the camera stream is available.

```bash
ros2 run ros2_control pose_estimation_node.py
```

This node reads camera input, estimates distance/yaw via CNN+gradient, and sends PID control commands to the ROV.

---

##  Evaluation

Use the `visualization/` scripts to generate error plots for:

- Distance convergence (gradient-based)
- Yaw alignment performance
- Detection accuracy (mAP, precision, recall)
